# Create target VM

Create a fresh VM with `vagrant` to use ansible on it with the following configuration
```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"

  config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.0.2"

  config.ssh.forward_agent    = true
  config.ssh.insert_key       = false
  config.ssh.private_key_path =  ["~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key","~/.ssh/id_rsa"]
  config.vm.provision :shell, privileged: false do |s|
    ssh_pub_key = File.readlines("#{Dir.home}/.ssh/id_rsa.pub").first.strip
    s.inline = <<-SHELL
      echo #{ssh_pub_key} >> /home/$USER/.ssh/authorized_keys
      sudo bash -c "echo #{ssh_pub_key} >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys"
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install -y python
    SHELL
  end
end
```

Ansible use ssh to connect to target VM and execute command on machines.  
This configuration add your local machine ssh keys to the accepted configuration of the custom VM.

# Installation

The instruction for installation can be found [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.5/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)  

# Inventory

Ansible works against multiple systems in your infrastructure at the same time. It does this by selecting portions of systems listed in Ansibleâ€™s inventory, which defaults to being saved in the location `/etc/ansible/hosts`. You can specify a different inventory file using the -i <path> option on the command line.

To work on your new configured VM,  add it's ip to the ansible inventory file `/etc/ansible/hosts`
```bash
echo 192.168.0.2 >> /etc/ansible/hosts
```

By doing this you add your VM to the global inventory of ansible in the all group (if you don't have already some groupe configured in this file ...).

You can test the connection to your VM with the ansible command, using the `ping` module.  
```bash
ansible all -u root -m ping 
```
The `-u` option define the suer to connect with on the VM.  
Th `-m` define the module to be executed on VMs from the all group
